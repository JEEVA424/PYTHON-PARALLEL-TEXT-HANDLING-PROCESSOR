Today is a good day. The weather is excellent and everyone feels happy.
However, the system had a bad error yesterday.
The performance was poor and the results were terrible.
Overall the project is great but some parts are bad.
There was an error in the database connection.
The user experience is good and the interface is excellent.
Some employees are sad about the poor performance.
