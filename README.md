# PYTHON-PARALLEL-TEXT-HANDLING-PROCESSOR
This project focuses on making a text handling processor that works at the same time, using Python's multi-tasking for breaking up text, a module for simple pattern finding, and a simple database for text storage. It has csv files for batch checks and email service for summaries. The system handles big text sets.
Completed:
        Python environment setup,
        SQLite database integration,
        Basic parallel text processing,
        Rule-based pattern matching,
        Sample text testing.
